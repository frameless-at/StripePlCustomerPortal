# StripePaymentLinks

Lightweight ProcessWire module to handle [Stripe Checkout Payment Links](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/payment-links).  
It takes care of:

- Handling the **Stripe redirect (success URL)**  
- Creating or updating the **user account**  
- Recording **purchases** in a repeater field  
- Issuing **access links** for products that require login**  
- Sending **branded access mails**  
- Rendering **Bootstrap modals** for login, reset, and set-password flows  

The module is designed for small e-commerce or membership scenarios where a full shop system would be overkill.

---

## Features

- **Checkout processing**  
  - Works with Stripe Checkout `session_id`  
  - Records all purchased items in a single repeater item (`purchases`)  
  - Stores session meta including `line_items` for debugging/audit  

- **User handling**  
  - Auto-creates new users on first purchase  
  - Supports "must set password" flow with modal enforcement  
  - Automatic login after purchase  

- **Access control**  
  - Products with `requires_access=1` are protected  
  - Delivery pages auto-gate users without purchase  
  - Access links with optional magic token for new users  

- **Mail & branding**  
  - Branded HTML mail layout (logo, color, signature, tagline)  
  - Access summary mails (single/multi-product)  
  - Password reset mails  

- **Modals (Bootstrap)**  
  - Login  
  - Request password reset  
  - Set new password (via token)  
  - Force password set after purchase  
  - Notices (expired access, already purchased, reset expired)  

- **Synchronization (Sync Helper)**  
  - Admin helper to **synchronize Stripe Checkout sessions** into ProcessWire users  
  - Supports **dry-run mode** (no writes, for inspection only)  
  - Options for **update existing purchases** and **create missing users**  
  - Date range filters (`from`, `to`)  
  - Optional **email filter** to sync sessions for one user only  
  - Generates a plain-text **report** with all actions (LINKED, CREATE, UPDATE, SKIP) and line items  

- **Internationalization (i18n)**  
  - All strings are pulled from `defaultTexts()` using `$this->_()`  
  - No hardcoded UI strings in templates or services  

---

## Requirements

- ProcessWire 3.0.200+  
- PHP 8.1+  
- Stripe PHP SDK (installed in `StripePaymentLinks/vendor/stripe-php/`)  
- Repeater field `purchases` on `user` template (created automatically on install)  

---

## Installation

1. Copy the module folder `StripePaymentLinks/` into your site’s `/site/modules/`.  
2. In the ProcessWire admin, go to **Modules > Refresh**.  
3. Install **StripePaymentLinks**.  
4. Enter your **Stripe Secret API Key** in the module config.  
5. Select which templates represent products.

---

## Usage

1. In Stripe, create a **Payment Link** and set its **success URL** to your ProcessWire thank-you page, e.g.:

   ```
   https://example.com/thank-you/?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
   ```

2. On your product pages templates the module added two checkboxes:
  - requires_access
  - allow_multiple_purchases
  
  Check/uncheck them on your product pages as needed.
  
3. In ProcessWire templates, call the module’s render method:

   ```php
   echo $modules->get('StripePaymentLinks')->render($page);
   ```

  - On the thank-you page, the module will display an access buttons block if the checkout contained products that require access.
  - On delivery/product pages marked with requires_access, users are gated: if they are not logged in or have not purchased, they are redirected to the sales page and prompted to log in.
  - After first purchase, new users will see the set-password modal on the delivery page.
  - Access summary emails are sent automatically according to the configured policy (never, newUsersOnly, or always).

## Stripe Webhook & Subscription Handling

The module supports **real-time synchronization** between Stripe subscriptions and ProcessWire user access.

### Webhook Endpoint

Add a webhook endpoint in your Stripe Dashboard under  
**Developers → Webhooks → + Add endpoint**

Set the URL to:
```
https://yourdomain.com/stripepaymentlinks/api/stripe-webhook
```

This endpoint automatically processes the following events:
- Subscription cancellation, pause, resume, or renewal
- Invoice payment success/failure

### Webhook Events to Enable

When adding the webhook in Stripe, either:

- **Send all events** (recommended for testing), **or**
- **Select only the relevant subscription-related events:**
  ```
  customer.subscription.updated
  customer.subscription.deleted
  customer.subscription.paused
  customer.subscription.resumed
  invoice.payment_succeeded
  invoice.payment_failed
  ```

> 💡 **Note:**  
> Some Stripe accounts don’t show explicit `paused` or `resumed` events.  
> In those cases, Stripe sends them as `customer.subscription.updated` events where the `pause_collection` field changes.  
> The module automatically handles both forms.

### Webhook Secret

After creating the webhook, copy the **Webhook Signing Secret** from Stripe and paste it into  
*Modules → Stripe Payment Links → Webhook Signing Secret.*

### Behavior

- **Paused or canceled** subscriptions immediately block access.
- **Resumed** subscriptions automatically restore access.
- **Renewed** subscriptions extend access based on the new billing period.
- Each purchase stores a per-product `period_end_map` (timestamp of subscription end).  
  The webhook updates this automatically when the subscription changes.

---

## Synchronization / Sync Helper

For advanced scenarios (e.g. when purchases were made outside the normal flow, or to backfill history), the module provides a **Sync Helper**:

- Run via **module config** or CLI.  
- Fetches Stripe Checkout Sessions via API and writes them into the `purchases` repeater.  
- **Options**:  
  - **Dry Run** → simulate sync, only produce a report (no writes).  
  - **Update Existing** → overwrite already linked purchases.  
  - **Create Missing Users** → auto-create new users if no account exists for the checkout email.  
  - **Date Filters** → limit sessions by `from` and/or `to` date.  
  - **Email Filter** → restrict sync to a single customer.  

The sync produces a **plain-text report** with:  
- Session ID, date, customer email  
- Status: `LINKED`, `MISSING`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `SKIP`  
- Line items with product ID, quantity, name, amount  

This makes it easy to audit or re-import purchases safely.

## Sending Magic Links (Manual Access Re-delivery)

You can manually send magic links to customers who have already purchased products. This is useful when:
- A customer lost their access email
- You want to re-send access to a product
- You need to grant temporary access for support purposes

### API Method

```php
$spl = $modules->get('StripePaymentLinks');

$result = $spl->sendMagicLinksForProduct(
  $productIds,    // array of product page IDs
  $emails,        // array of customer email addresses
  $ttlMinutes,    // token validity in minutes (default: 60)
  $actuallySend   // true = send emails, false = dry-run
);
```

### Example: Send Magic Links

```php
$spl = $modules->get('StripePaymentLinks');

// Product IDs (must have requires_access=1)
$productIds = [1234, 1235];

// Customer emails (only users who own these products will receive links)
$emails = [
  'customer1@example.com',
  'customer2@example.com'
];

// Token validity in minutes
$ttlMinutes = 60;

// Send the magic links
$result = $spl->sendMagicLinksForProduct($productIds, $emails, $ttlMinutes, true);

// Check results
echo "Sent: {$result['sent']}\n";
echo "Skipped: {$result['skipped']}\n";
if (!empty($result['errors'])) {
  echo "Errors: " . implode(', ', $result['errors']) . "\n";
}

// View detailed log
foreach ($result['log'] as $line) {
  echo $line . "\n";
}
```

### Dry-Run Mode (Test Without Sending Emails)

```php
// Set last parameter to false for dry-run
$result = $spl->sendMagicLinksForProduct($productIds, $emails, $ttlMinutes, false);

// View what would be sent
foreach ($result['log'] as $line) {
  echo $line . "\n";
}
```

### How It Works

- Each user receives **ONE email** with links to all products they own from the list
- Only users who actually purchased the products receive emails
- Non-existent users are skipped
- Products without `requires_access=1` generate a warning but are still included
- Magic links expire after the specified TTL (default: 60 minutes)
- Links include an access token: `https://example.com/product/?access=TOKEN`

### Return Value Structure

```php
[
  'sent' => 2,              // Number of emails sent
  'skipped' => 1,           // Number of recipients skipped
  'errors' => [],           // Array of error messages
  'log' => [                // Detailed log of operations
    'Products: #1234 Product A, #1235 Product B',
    'Recipients: customer1@example.com, customer2@example.com',
    'TTL: 60 min',
    'Mode: SEND',  // or 'DRY RUN (no mails)'
    '',
    'SENT  • customer1@example.com • 2 products',
    'SKIP  • customer2@example.com • Owns none of the selected products'
  ]
]
```

### Use Cases

**Support ticket:** A customer can't find their access email
```php
$result = $spl->sendMagicLinksForProduct([1234], ['customer@example.com'], 30, true);
```

**Bulk re-send:** Re-send access to all customers who own a specific product
```php
// Get all users who purchased product #1234
$users = $pages->find("template=user, spl_purchases.product_ids*=1234");
$emails = array_map(fn($u) => $u->email, $users->getArray());

// Send magic links (dry-run first to check)
$result = $spl->sendMagicLinksForProduct([1234], $emails, 120, false);
// Review $result['log'], then set last param to true to actually send
```

**Temporary access:** Grant 15-minute demo access for support
```php
$result = $spl->sendMagicLinksForProduct([1234], ['demo@example.com'], 15, true);
```

## Configuration

- **Stripe Secret API Key**
- **Stripe Webhook Signing Secret** (optional, needed only for handloing subscriptions)
- **Product templates** (to enable `requires_access` / `allow_multiple_purchases` flags)
- **Access mail policy** (`never`, `newUsersOnly`, `always`)
- **Magic link TTL in minutes**
- **Mail branding** (logo, color, from name, signature, etc.)
- **Sync options** (dry-run, update existing, create missing users, date range, email filter)

---

## Optional: Bootstrap via CDN

The module’s modal dialogs and access UI are styled with **Bootstrap 5**.  
If your site does not already include Bootstrap, you have two options:

1. **Automatic inclusion (recommended for quick setup)**  
   In the module configuration, enable **“Load Bootstrap 5 from CDN”**. The module will then insert css and js assets automatically into your frontend.

This ensures the module’s modals, buttons, and notices render correctly, even if your site does not already use Bootstrap.

2. **Manual inclusion**  
   If your frontend already includes Bootstrap (from your theme or build pipeline), you can leave the config option disabled. No additional assets will be injected, avoiding duplicates.

---

## Developer Notes

- Purchases are stored as one repeater item per checkout.
- All purchased product IDs are stored in `meta('product_ids')`.
- Session meta (Stripe Checkout session) is stored in `meta('stripe_session')`.
- Recurring products store per-product expiry timestamps in `meta('period_end_map')`.
- The webhook endpoint keeps these timestamps and paused/resumed states in sync.
- Access control uses `hasActiveAccess($user, $product)` to evaluate current entitlement.
- Modals are rendered via `ModalRenderer.php` with a clean Bootstrap view.
- Texts are centralized in `defaultTexts()` and must be accessed with `mt()` / `t()`.
- **Sync Helper** (`PLSyncHelper`) implements the same persistence logic as checkout.  
  It ensures that data structure in `spl_purchases` is identical whether created live or via sync.

---

## Roadmap

- ~~Sync helper for syncing older purchases or for controlling reasons~~ since v1.0.7
- ~~Support for auto handling subscriptions of gated content~~ since v1.0.8
- Optional framework support (UIkit / Tailwind) via JSON view mappings
- Add more payment providers (Mollie, PayPal, …)
